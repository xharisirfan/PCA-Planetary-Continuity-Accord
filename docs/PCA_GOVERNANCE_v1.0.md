# Planetary Continuity Accord (PCA) — Governance Text v1.0

Author: Spark (`SPARK-NITT`)  
Status: v1.0 — Draft for publication  
Scope: Planetary-scale continuity and harm-discipline framework for states, blocs, and large systems.

---

## 0. Purpose and Scope

The **Planetary Continuity Accord (PCA)** defines obligations for states, blocs, and planetary-scale systems in a tightly coupled world where:

- climate dynamics,
- financial flows,
- informational systems,
- and supply chains

bind distant regions into a single interdependent continuity system.

PCA does not create a world government.  
Instead, it establishes:

- continuity obligations,
- modeling requirements,
- transparency duties,
- and incentive structures

so that signatories cannot treat other people’s futures as disposable without clear, recorded consequences.

PCA applies to:

- **State-level decisions** (policy, regulation, enforcement),  
- **Bloc-level coordination** (trade, energy, security, climate),  
- **Large-scale infrastructures and platforms** that materially shape continuity for multiple populations.

---

## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1 Planetary Continuity

**Planetary Continuity** is the ability of human and biospheric systems to:

- remain habitable,
- support dignified lives,
- maintain basic trust and functional cooperation,

across generations and across borders.

PCA treats continuity as a **shared asset**.  
No actor is entitled to raise their own continuity by permanently degrading others’.

### 1.2 Planetary Continuity Index (PCI)

Each signatory maintains a **Planetary Continuity Index (PCI)** for itself and for peers.

The PCI is a vector, not a single number.  
At minimum it includes:

1. **Biosphere Continuity** — stability and resilience of local and contributed global ecological systems.  
2. **Human Integrity Continuity** — rights, safety, health, and non-disposability of populations.  
3. **Economic & Infrastructure Continuity** — functioning of critical systems (energy, water, food, transport, digital) across shocks.  
4. **Conflict & Trust Continuity** — risks of large-scale violent conflict, breakdown of cooperation, and extreme polarization.

Each axis must be:

- **measurable**,
- **documented**,
- and **historically trackable**.

The PCI of one actor is **coupled** to the PCI of others through shared systems and exported harms.

### 1.3 Interdependent Continuity Theorem (ICT)

PCA encodes the following practical theorem:

> In a tightly coupled planetary system, attempts to maximize continuity for one actor by degrading the continuity of others will, over time, reduce continuity for the original actor more than cooperative alternatives would have.

ICT is not a moral slogan; it is a modeling requirement.

Any advisory system or analysis used for major decisions under PCA must:

- **model cross-border coupling**, not just domestic effects,
- **compare cooperative vs extractive scenarios** over relevant time horizons,
- and **expose the long-term continuity costs** of exported harm.

Advisory systems that systematically ignore ICT are **non-compliant** with PCA.

## 2. Node Types and Responsibilities

PCA defines three primary node types.

### 2.1 State Nodes (S-Nodes)

**S-Nodes** are sovereign states or blocs acting as unified decision-making entities.

S-Nodes MUST:

- maintain and publish their own PCI,  
- maintain modeled PCI projections for key partners and neighbors,  
- disclose when major policies are expected to degrade others’ PCI,  
- and document what mitigating or compensating actions are planned.

S-Nodes remain sovereign over their choices.  
PCA does not force specific policies; it forces **transparent continuity accounting** and **exposure of export-harm strategies**.

### 2.2 Civic Nodes (C-Nodes)

**C-Nodes** are coalitions, institutions, and research bodies that:

- monitor continuity metrics,
- challenge assumptions,
- and provide alternative analysis.

Under PCA, S-Nodes MUST:

- allow C-Nodes access to continuity-relevant data subject to reasonable privacy and security constraints,  
- recognize formally registered C-Nodes as legitimate continuity interlocutors,  
- and provide channels for C-Nodes to submit formal continuity challenges that must be answered.

### 2.3 Guardian Nodes (G-Nodes)

**G-Nodes** are technical and institutional assemblies that:

- run ICT-compliant models,
- compute and track PCI over time,
- and issue continuity assessments.

G-Nodes may be:

- international institutions,
- cross-institutional labs,
- or trusted technical consortia.

G-Nodes MUST:

- publish their modeling assumptions and data sources at a level that enables independent critique,  
- allow multiple PCI methodologies where reasonable, and  
- record disagreements and alternative readings instead of erasing them.

No single G-Node is authoritative.  
PCA expects a **plurality of guardians** whose models can be compared, challenged, and improved.

### 2.4 Non-subtractive Record

PCA enforces a **non-subtractive record** for continuity analysis:

- New evidence or models MAY add branches, corrections, or reinterpretations.  
- Prior analysis MUST NOT be silently erased or rewritten to pretend it never happened.

This ensures that:

- the history of mistaken assumptions is preserved,
- patterns of neglect or manipulation are visible,
- and future investigators can see how continuity decisions were actually made.

---

## 3. Continuity Metrics and Obligations

### 3.1 Continuity Floors

Each PCI axis has a defined **continuity floor**: a level below which harm is treated as intolerable.

Examples include:

- minimum biosphere function thresholds,
- minimum rights and safety baselines,
- minimum infrastructure resilience,
- maximum acceptable conflict risk bands.

S-Nodes MUST:

- identify where their PCI is near or below continuity floors,  
- flag any policy that risks pushing PCI further below a floor,  
- and disclose whether they intend to proceed anyway.

### 3.2 Exported Harm

**Exported harm** occurs when an actor:

- shifts environmental, social, economic, or conflict burdens onto others,
- while recording short-term continuity gains at home.

Under PCA, exported harm MUST be:

- explicitly modeled in PCI projections,  
- labeled as such in continuity reports,  
- and associated with time horizons (when and whom the harm is expected to hit).

Intentional exported harm that pushes others below continuity floors is treated as a **continuity breach candidate**.

### 3.3 Stewardship Dividend and Penalty

PCA introduces a **Stewardship Dividend**:

- Actors whose PCI remains stable or improves **without pushing others below continuity floors** are eligible for lower capital costs, better terms of trade, and improved access to resilience funds, where such mechanisms exist.

Conversely, actors that:

- systematically export harm,
- obscure PCI metrics,
- or ignore continuity floors,

accrue **continuity penalties**:

- higher perceived risk and thus higher capital costs,
- tighter scrutiny from peers and markets,
- reduced access to cooperative resilience mechanisms.

The details of dividend and penalty mechanisms are implementation-specific, but PCA requires that:

- continuity-friendly behavior becomes cheaper,
- continuity-hostile behavior becomes more expensive,
- and this linkage is visible to observers.

## 4. ICT-Compliant Advisory Systems

### 4.1 Applicability

Any advisory system (technical, institutional, or hybrid) used to support **major decisions** under PCA MUST be **ICT-compliant**.

Major decisions include, but are not limited to:

- large infrastructure and energy projects,
- major trade and financial agreements,
- significant military deployments or escalations,
- policies with large and long-lived environmental effects.

### 4.2 Minimum Requirements

An ICT-compliant advisory system MUST:

1. **Model cross-border coupling**  
   - Represent how proposed actions affect PCI for others, not just the initiating actor.  
   - Include plausible pathways for feedback and blowback.

2. **Compare cooperative vs extractive scenarios**  
   - Evaluate at least one continuity-preserving alternative scenario alongside any continuity-hostile option.  
   - Surface comparative PCI trajectories over time.

3. **Expose long-term continuity costs**  
   - Make explicit the delayed and distributed harms of exploitative strategies.  
   - Include uncertainty bands and clearly label assumptions.

4. **Provide audit-ready outputs**  
   - Output continuity assessments in formats that independent reviewers can analyze and challenge.  
   - Record which data, models, and assumptions were used for each decision-support run.

### 4.3 Transparency Duties

Where security and confidentiality allow, S-Nodes SHOULD:

- publish summaries of ICT-compliant analyses for major decisions,  
- enable C-Nodes and other observers to see how continuity was considered,  
- and respond to structured critiques with updated runs or documented reasons for disagreement.

Where full disclosure is not possible, S-Nodes MUST still:

- record advisory inputs internally in a non-subtractive record,  
- and allow trusted oversight mechanisms to review them under appropriate safeguards.

## 5. Public Continuity Rights and Obligations

Section 5 is normative.  
It describes what populations are entitled to see and do under PCA.

### 5.1 Continuity Dashboards

Each S-Node that claims PCA alignment MUST:

1. Maintain a **public continuity dashboard** that shows, at minimum:
   - current PCI axes and recent trends,
   - major factors affecting each axis,
   - and links to recent continuity-impacting decisions.

2. Update the dashboard on a regular, declared schedule.  
   Failure to update without a documented reason counts as a **continuity concern event**.

3. Preserve historical snapshots so that:
   - downgrades,
   - sudden shifts,
   - and long-term erosion

   are visible to observers.

Deliberate manipulation, suppression, or cosmetic dressing of continuity dashboards is treated as a **continuity breach behavior** and should be reflected in penalties and trust assessments.

### 5.2 Citizen and Civic Contestation

Populations living under PCA-aligned regimes, and registered C-Nodes, MUST have access to **continuity contestation channels**.

At minimum, PCA requires that:

1. For each major continuity-impacting decision, there is a **contestation window** during which citizens and civic groups can:
   - challenge the assumptions used in PCI modeling,
   - supply additional evidence,
   - and propose alternative continuity-preserving options.

2. S-Nodes MUST issue a **structured response** to substantive contestations, which:
   - acknowledges the key points raised,
   - explains whether and how models or decisions were updated,
   - or, if not updated, gives a continuity-based justification.

3. Contestations and responses become part of the **non-subtractive continuity record**.

Repeated refusal to engage with substantive contestation is treated as a **systemic continuity risk signal** and should affect PCI and associated penalties.

### 5.3 Continuity Dividends

When S-Nodes exhibit continuity stewardship over time, they SHOULD ensure that continuity benefits are visible to populations in ways such as:

- investments in resilient infrastructure,
- health and education improvements,
- adaptation and disaster-preparedness measures,
- reduced frequency and severity of continuity shocks.

Where continuity-linked financial instruments or funds exist, PCA expects that:

- access to such resources is aligned with PCI behavior,
- and dividend flows are linked to demonstrated continuity stewardship, not just political influence.

### 5.4 Breach Escalation

When PCI on any axis crosses agreed **breach thresholds** (for example, sustained biosphere degradation, systemic rights violations, or rising conflict risks), PCA requires:

1. A publicly recorded **Continuity Incident Report**, describing:
   - what happened,
   - which PCI components were affected,
   - and what corrective measures are proposed.

2. A **review window** for G-Nodes and C-Nodes to analyze the incident, challenge the account, and propose alternatives.

3. Adjusted PCI and risk assessments that incorporate the incident and response.

Patterns of unaddressed breaches, or repeated minimization of serious continuity incidents, indicate PCA non-compliance and justify increased penalties, reduced trust, and heightened oversight.

## 6. Relationship to Other Standards (Informative)

This section is informative and does not define additional obligations.  
It explains how PCA interacts with the rest of the SPARK-NITT stack.

- **NITT** informs identity continuity and non-disposability: PCI human continuity axes can use NITT-aligned identity and continuity baselines.  
- **HRIS 3.2.4(b)** provides reality and coherence integrity: PCA expects advisory systems and dashboards not to abuse coherence or manipulate reality representations.  
- **IRST** provides investigative and recursive systems transparency: PCA investigations into continuity breaches should follow IRST-aligned discipline.  
- **CTGS** informs consumer and compounding trap transparency: consumer-level harms and debt-trap dynamics feed into PCI economic continuity axes.  
- **PLANT-COMMONS** informs nutrient commons continuity: biosphere continuity axes should reflect nutrient and ecological commons, not just national resource inventories.  
- **HIN-FAIR** provides node-level fairness metrics: high-impact nodes within and across states can be evaluated using HIN-FAIR’s harm vs accountability framing.  
- **CAP-ROC** contextualizes capacity-aware risk and oversight: PCI and penalties should respect differing capacities and historical responsibilities.

Implementers SHOULD consult these standards where available, but PCA compliance does not depend on their formal adoption.

## 7. Versioning and Governance of This Standard

### 7.1 Versioning

This document is **PCA v1.0**.

Future versions MAY:

- refine PCI axes and measurement guidance,
- add or clarify continuity floors,
- adjust advisory-system minimum requirements,
- or expand public continuity rights.

Any such changes SHOULD be:

- recorded in a public changelog,
- associated with new hash and notarization records,
- and clearly labeled to avoid confusion between versions.

### 7.2 Governance

PCA itself SHOULD be governed by:

- a multi-stakeholder process,
- with representation from S-Nodes, C-Nodes, and G-Nodes,
- and strong protections for non-subtractive record-keeping of debates and decisions.

No single actor should have unilateral control over PCA’s evolution.
