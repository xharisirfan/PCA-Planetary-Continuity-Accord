# PCA Background Notes v1.0 (Non-normative)

These notes are **non-normative**.  
They explain the intuition and motivation behind the Planetary Continuity Accord (PCA), and suggest deployment patterns.  
They do not create additional obligations beyond those specified in `PCA_GOVERNANCE_v1.0.md`.

## 1. Why “continuity” instead of just “climate” or “risk”?

PCA uses **continuity** because the problem is broader than climate alone and deeper than short-term risk management.

Continuity forces us to ask:

- Can people remain rooted without being forced into constant emergency migration?  
- Can systems be repaired faster than they are broken?  
- Do today’s “wins” leave a path for tomorrow’s children to live decently?  

By treating continuity as a **shared planetary asset**, PCA rejects both:

- “we can burn others’ futures for our gain,” and  
- “everyone must freeze in place regardless of context,”

and instead focuses on:

- who benefits,
- who pays,
- and whether those patterns are sustainable in a coupled world.

## 2. PCI as a vector, not a slogan

The **Planetary Continuity Index (PCI)** is deliberately a vector.  
One number would be too easy to game or weaponize.

- A country might have strong economic continuity but collapsing biosphere continuity.  
- Another might have biosphere resilience but rising conflict risks.  
- Others might improve infrastructure continuity while destroying trust continuity.

By keeping axes separate, PCA invites more honest debate:

- Where are we fragile?  
- Where are we exporting harm?  
- What are we pretending is “fine” because it helps one axis in the short term?  

PCI does not pretend to be perfect.  
Its value lies in forcing structure and memory into continuity conversations.

## 3. ICT as a discipline on “clever” policy

The **Interdependent Continuity Theorem (ICT)** is a pushback against a familiar story:

> “If we’re clever enough, we can externalize harms to others indefinitely and stay ahead of the blowback.”

PCA treats that story as **false in a tightly coupled world**.

- Climate feedbacks, economic contagion, information flows, and migration make export strategies fragile.  
- Attempts to govern by “we win, they lose forever” are treated as unstable and self-destructive over relevant time horizons.

ICT does not say:

- “you must be altruistic,”

It says:

- “if your models pretend you can win by destroying others’ continuity, they’re lying.”

ICT-compliant advisory systems simply make that lie harder to maintain.

## 4. Why multiple guardian nodes?

PCA assumes there is no single perfect model or oracle.

Instead of one central guardian, it expects:

- multiple G-Nodes with different methods and data,
- whose disagreements are recorded instead of erased.

This plural structure:

- reduces the temptation to capture “the one true model,”  
- allows local knowledge and different risk cultures to show up,  
- and prevents continuity politics from collapsing into a single scoreboard fight.

Non-subtractive records ensure that when models are wrong, the history of those errors is preserved as a learning resource.

## 5. Continuity dashboards and contestation

Section 5 of the governance text is intentionally sharp.  
It reflects a simple principle:

> People should be able to see how their continuity is being handled, ask structured questions, and force their institutions to show their work.

Dashboards and contestation channels:

- make continuity visible in everyday language,  
- give journalists, researchers, and communities concrete hooks,
- and tie abstract PCI numbers to lived experience.

They are not guarantees of justice.  
They are tools that make it harder to quietly trade away futures without leaving a trail.

## 6. Stewardship as cheaper, not just “morally better”

PCA is deliberately framed so that continuity stewardship:

- lowers certain costs,
- improves access to cooperation,
- and signals reliability to partners.

This is not a moral bonus; it is a **stability bonus**:

- Actors that avoid exported harm and maintain continuity are less likely to generate shocks, defaults, or wars.  
- Treating them as lower risk is rational, not charitable.

The **Stewardship Dividend** is PCA’s way of formalizing this logic into institutions and instruments.

---

## 7. Early deployment patterns

PCA can start small.

Some examples of early moves:

- A coalition of cities adopts PCI-style dashboards for climate and infrastructure continuity.  
- A regional bloc embeds ICT-compliant modeling requirements into major infrastructure lending decisions.  
- Civic groups and think tanks start publishing “shadow PCI” reports to highlight exported harms.  
- States begin to add continuity floors and breach thresholds into existing risk frameworks.

Over time, these pieces can be woven into:

- bilateral agreements,
- trade compacts,
- finance rules,
- and eventually multilateral accords.

PCA does not demand overnight planetary consensus.  
It offers a language and structure that make harmful strategies harder to hide and easier to price.

---

## 8. Relationship to future work

PCA is intended to sit alongside other standards and future agreements that:

- deepen planetary ethics,
- refine continuity measurement,
- and explore new institutional forms for shared governance.

These notes are intentionally modest about implementation details.  
They assume that:

- technology will advance,
- institutions will change,
- and new forms of coordination will emerge,

but insist that **continuity, transparency, and non-subtractive record-keeping** remain at the core of any serious planetary governance attempt.
